Following our discussion on issue #1195, I decided to create some additional examples/demos.

This directory will include the examples from my most recent reply and HTML they can all be HTML because HTML can include `<style>` and `<script>` tags, in addition to HTML itself.

I'll also include the code I have been working on as a proof of concept for anyone else that might find it useful.

Apologies for not submitting PHP the project I'm working on is a Django (Python 3) application and so I'm working in HTML, CSS and JS (the pnly pre-processor I am using is the SCSS flavor of SASS).

At least one example in this fork (my working proof of concept) is static HTML (no Python, I'm just making making sure everything works before implementation in Django) with links to files on CDNs.

The libraries in use on proof of concept files will be [Foundation](https://get.foundation) 6.6.x, which uses the [X-Y Grid](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/xy-grid.html), [jQuery](https://releases.jquery.com) 3.X, and [NoUiSlider](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/nouislider) 15.X

NOTE: Those proof of concept files include minimal styling and have not been optimized for production in any way.
